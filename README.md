# Data-Driven Bayesian Parameter Estimation with Neural Networks for Power Grid Frequency
This repository contains the code for the Bachelor's Thesis "Data-Driven Bayesian Parameter Estimation with Neural Networks for Power Grid Frequency" at KIT.

We recommend using `conda` for creating a virtual environment as follows:

    conda create -n sbi_env python=3.9 
    conda activate sbi_env
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  
The enumeration of the files reflects their recommended execution order.
Most importantly, ensure that the respective posterior estimates have been calculated via `01_train.py` before executing the code of the evaluation part of the thesis.  

### Datasets
The datasets used in this thesis can be obtained from:
  
 - Continental European Grid: [Pre-Processed Power Grid Frequency Time Series](https://zenodo.org/records/5105820)
 - Balearic Grid: [Open Access Power-Grid Frequency Database](https://osf.io/m43tg/) and [Red El√©ctrica Dashboard](https://demanda.ree.es/visiona/baleares/baleares5m/tablas/2019-11-6/1)
 
The daytime-specific parameter ranges used in the thesis are extracted from the [supplementary data](https://github.com/johkruse/PIML-for-grid-frequency-modelling) to the paper "Physics-informed machine learning for power grid frequency modelling" by Kruse et al. 
Specifically, we insert these three lines of code into the cell which generates Figure 3 in the given `paper_plots.ipynb`  notebook to extract the relevant data:

    np.savetxt(name + "_mean.txt", p_daily_means.reset_index().reindex(np.arange(0,24,1/60)).ffill().loc[:,name].values*param_rescaling[name])
    np.savetxt(name + "_q25.txt", p_daily_q25.reset_index().reindex(np.arange(0,24,1/60)).ffill().loc[:,name].values*param_rescaling[name])
    np.savetxt(name + "_q75.txt", p_daily_q75.reset_index().reindex(np.arange(0,24,1/60)).ffill().loc[:,name].values*param_rescaling[name])
Our notebook `00_methodology_daytime_specific.ipynb` then converts the extracted data to a CSV file later used by `01_train.py`.
